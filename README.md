# Flood-in-Ruby-on-Rails
Assumptions and Overview

The original flood.py script generates random user agents and referral links. For a Rails-based system:

    Model Layer: A class for generating random data (Agent and Referral models).
    Controller Layer: Exposes endpoints for generating random agents and referrals.
    View Layer: Minimalistic views for demonstration purposes, typically JSON outputs.

Implementation
1. Model Classes

Models for managing user agents and referrals.

app/models/referral.rb

class Referral
  REFERRALS = [
    "www.ibm.com/watson/",
    "cloud.google.com/products/ai/",
    "azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/ai/",
    # Add all other referral links here...
  ].freeze

  def self.random
    REFERRALS.sample
  end
end

app/models/agent.rb

class Agent
  USER_AGENTS = [
    "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/4.0; Acoo Browser 1.98.744; .NET CLR 3.5.30729)",
    "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)",
    # Add all other user agents here...
  ].freeze

  def self.random
    USER_AGENTS.sample
  end
end

2. Controller

A controller to handle API requests for generating random agents and referrals.

app/controllers/random_controller.rb

class RandomController < ApplicationController
  def referral
    render json: { referral: Referral.random }
  end

  def agent
    render json: { user_agent: Agent.random }
  end
end

3. Routes

Define routes to expose these actions.

config/routes.rb

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'random/referral', to: 'random#referral'
  get 'random/agent', to: 'random#agent'
end

4. Testing the API

Once set up:

    Navigate to http://localhost:3000/random/referral for a random referral link.
    Navigate to http://localhost:3000/random/agent for a random user agent.

Deployment and Usage

    Run Rails Server: Start the Rails application using rails server.
    Integrate with Frontend/Other Services: Use these endpoints to fetch random referrals and user agents programmatically.

Advantages of This Approach

    Scalability: Future extensions, like persisting generated data, can easily integrate into Rails.
    Security: Rails' built-in mechanisms like CSRF protection ensure safety.
    Maintainability: Well-organized and modular structure.
